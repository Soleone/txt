# EOS Watchdogs

## Investigative Agents

Independent organization collecting information about the 21 active block producers.

### What

* Publish reports for community
* Different report types:
  * Introductory Overview of BP
    * Team
    * Finance
    * Location
    * Server setup
    * Roadmap
    * EOS community contributions
  * BP Update
    * Changes since last report
    * Regular interval, e.g. every 4-12 weeks
  * Specific allegations, e.g. vote buying
    * Who gets to decide which allegations are fully investigated like this?
    * Referendum from token holders?
    
### How  

* Prioritize new BPs and the ones producing the most blocks 
* BPs can cooperate and answer standardized questionnaires or give official interviews
* Team of at least 2 people investigating a single BP
* Funded by donations
  * BPs could be incentivized to fund to set good example ("nothing to hide")
* Review of the investigative report is required to handle bribed investigators 
  * Review by at least 2 other investigators (too complex in the beginning most likely)
  * Review by community
